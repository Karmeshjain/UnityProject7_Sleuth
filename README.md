-------

For the animation, we created most of the animation part in the unity animation editor and
some animation download via internet.
Animations are used in reloading of both guns ,shooting animation of both guns ,Enemy
player patrol,idle,walk,run,And die animation.and also one animation used for screen fade
in fade out for 2 seconds in starting.

<img width="100%" src="Sleuth/screenshots/34.png" />

And after that, we use a component called ANIMATOR to apply trigger
to each animation. So that each animation will play after the execution of
a specific function not before that.
